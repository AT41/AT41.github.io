            Throughout my education growing up in Calgary, I have always loved science and mathematics even from a young age. 
            After trying my first Computer Science elective at Western High School and winning my first programming competition, 
            I decided to pursue it as my major at U of C.<br>
            
            During my undergraduate I found myself taking tons of Japanese language courses, and loved meeting people who shared the same passions about learning as I did.
            Volunteering as a Teaching Assistant for lower level classes and conversing with others in Japanese was exciting and, despite language classes taking up more time 
            to study for than all my other classes combined, I never grew tired of it and I'm proud that I stuck with it through my degree.<br>

            At the top I've linked some of my personal projects I was passionate in developing throughout the years.<br>

                For my fourth year I did a 16 month internship, making medical-based applications with TypeScript and Angular. It was startling to
                realize how little my university classes did to prepare me for my internship, since I had no technical experience with real web development
                at the time. Fortunately for me, my boss was patient and understanding as I stumbled around my first month, and I was able to pick up
                TypeScript and Angular, learn to use git through the CLI, and a lot more.
                As I started getting into the groove of working, I looked for Japanese tutors and took one on one lessons Tuesdays and Thursdays, so
                my Japanese would not get rusty during my hiatus away from university classes. Overall, my internship experience was very useful towards my growth as a developer.
